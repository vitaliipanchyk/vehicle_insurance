Hello there!
In this repo you can find python files of Vehicle Insurance pet project mentioned in my blog "Code the Dice" on Medium. 

1. "Accuracy Paradox.py" - is an example of trap you can get in while using imbalanced data for building a classification model. Pay attention at the difference between accuracy score and f1 score of models. The reason of that you can find in my article.
2. "Undersampling.py" - shows one method you can use to fix a problem of imbalanced dataset. The idea is to shorten the number of minor class observations.
3. "Undersampling+Log.py" - just a try to improve previous method using Log Transform on some of variables.
4. "Oversampling.py" - here you can see another method of dealing with imbalanced data. 
5. "Oversampling+Log.py" - the same improvement of our variables we used previously.
6. "Train.csv" - training data for my models.

Feel free to comment on my GitHub or Medium Blog regarding possible ways to further improve my models.
